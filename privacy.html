    <p class="rules__content">It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4 class="rules__title">Automatic collection of information</h4>
    <p class="rules__content">When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
    <p class="rules__content">Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4 class="rules__title">Collection of personal information</h4>
    <p class="rules__content">You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Website's features, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, or fill any online forms on the Website. When required, this information may include the following:</p>

</div>
<div>
    <h4 class="rules__title">Managing personal information</h4>
    <p class="rules__content">You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Website or Services change.

If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so on the settings page of your account on the Website or simply by contacting us.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4 class="rules__title">Storing personal information</h4>
    <p class="rules__content">We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4 class="rules__title">Use and processing of collected information</h4>
    <p class="rules__content">In order to make our Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information.

In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p></p>
</div>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<div>

    <p class="rules__content">Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked.

How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, this Website is not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.</p>
